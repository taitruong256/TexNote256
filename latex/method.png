\section{Introduction}

Evaluating programming comprehension in large language models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge. While many LLMs demonstrate strong code generation capabilities, their ability to analyze, reason, and understand software engineering principles is less explored. The CodeMMLU Challenge provides a structured benchmark to assess programming knowledge through multiple-choice questions covering topics such as code analysis, debugging, and system design. Unlike traditional benchmarks that focus on syntax and code completion, this evaluation aims to measure deeper reasoning and problem-solving skills in software development.

Several existing models have been optimized for technical reasoning. GPT-4o builds upon OpenAI’s advancements in general AI reasoning, but algorithmic problem-solving remains an open question. DeepSeek-V3 is specifically trained on programming-related datasets, making it a strong candidate for software engineering tasks. Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash is optimized for efficiency in code-related queries, while Llama 3 70B Instruct offers transparency as an open-weight model.

Due to constraints in time and computational resources, training models from scratch or fine-tuning them was not feasible for this study. Instead, I evaluated existing pre-trained models using API-based inference to ensure a practical and reproducible benchmarking process. This approach allows for direct comparison of state-of-the-art models under controlled conditions while maintaining consistency in input format and evaluation methodology.

\section{Methodology}

\end{figure}

The evaluation follows a structured four-stage process, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:method}, consisting of prompt construction, API-based inference, response validation, and result aggregation. This pipeline ensures a standardized and robust assessment across multiple models.

The process begins with prompt construction, where raw multiple-choice questions from a CSV dataset are transformed into a consistent format. Each prompt explicitly presents a question, four answer choices, and a directive instructing models to return a single-letter response (A, B, C, or D). This structured format eliminates ambiguities and ensures that all models receive uniform input.

During inference, API requests are executed in parallel for four models: Deepseek-V3, Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4o, and Llama 3 70B Instruct. To enhance efficiency, questions are processed in batches of 5–10 per request. The system incorporates robust error-handling mechanisms, including automatic retries, to manage rate limits and network timeouts. Each API call adheres to a predefined structure, including authentication credentials and content headers, to maintain stable and reliable communication with model endpoints.

Once responses are collected, they undergo systematic validation to ensure compliance with the expected multiple-choice format. The system extracts and records answers from JSON outputs, enforcing strict adherence to the single-character response format. Any anomalies, such as missing or improperly formatted responses, are logged for further inspection. This step guarantees data integrity before performance analysis.

In the final stage, a majority voting mechanism is applied to reconcile differences in model predictions. When responses vary, the system selects the most frequently chosen answer as the final decision. If no clear majority exists, alternative resolution strategies, such as confidence-weighted voting, may be employed to enhance stability. The final results are compiled into a structured CSV output, containing question identifiers and model-generated answers, with optional confidence scores when available.

\section{Execution and Results}

The results of the evaluation highlight significant differences in model performance. Table~\ref{tab:results} summarizes the accuracy scores achieved by each model on the CodeMMLU benchmark.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lcc}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Model} & \textbf{API Source} & \textbf{Accuracy Score} \\
        \midrule
        GPT-4o & OpenAI & 0.70 \\
        DeepSeek-V3 & OpenRouter & 0.75 \\
        Gemini-2.0-Flash & Google AI & 0.72 \\
        Llama 3 70B Instruct & Together AI & 0.62 \\
        Voting Ensemble & Combination & 0.71 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Comparative model performance on CodeMMLU benchmark}
    \label{tab:results}
\end{table}

Among the models evaluated, DeepSeek-V3 achieved the highest accuracy at 75\%, indicating strong capabilities in programming-related reasoning tasks. The variance in accuracy scores suggests differences in how each model approaches software engineering problems. The ensemble method, based on majority voting, achieved an accuracy of 71\%, demonstrating its effectiveness in leveraging multiple model outputs to improve performance.

The evaluation pipeline processed all responses efficiently, with no significant bottlenecks. The distribution of answer choices across options (A, B, C, D) appeared balanced, indicating that models did not exhibit biases toward specific choices.

Despite these results, there are notable limitations. The enforced single-character response format does not capture the reasoning behind model decisions, making it difficult to analyze why a particular answer was chosen. Additionally, prompt length constraints may have limited the amount of contextual information available for complex programming questions.

\section{Improvement Strategies}

Several strategies can be employed to enhance model performance in programming comprehension tasks.

\subsubsection*{4.1 Fine-Tuning on Programming Datasets}

Training models on high-quality, domain-specific datasets can significantly improve their reasoning capabilities. By incorporating diverse programming problems, ranging from algorithmic challenges to software engineering case studies, models can develop a deeper understanding of computational logic and design principles.

\subsubsection*{4.2 Chain-of-Thought Reasoning}

Instead of directly predicting an answer, models can be guided to generate intermediate reasoning steps before selecting a final response. This approach encourages structured thinking and has been shown to improve accuracy in tasks requiring logical inference.

\subsubsection*{4.3 Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning}

Providing contextual examples of similar problems before querying the model can enhance its generalization capabilities. Few-shot learning methods, where a small number of example solutions are included in the prompt, allow models to adjust their reasoning approach based on prior demonstrations.

\subsubsection*{4.4 Optimized Ensemble Strategies}

Beyond simple majority voting, more sophisticated ensemble methods can be employed. Confidence-weighted voting assigns different levels of trust to models based on their past performance in specific question categories. This technique optimally integrates multiple model outputs to increase reliability.

\section{Conclusion}

This evaluation identified DeepSeek-V3 as the strongest model for programming-related questions, achieving 75\% accuracy under controlled conditions. The analysis highlights key differences in technical reasoning capabilities across models while identifying areas for improvement. Future work can focus on fine-tuning models on specialized datasets, applying chain-of-thought prompting, and optimizing ensemble strategies to enhance performance in programming question-answering tasks.
